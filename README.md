# System Requirement
For achieving a dual polarized patch antenna , it’s required to have two orthogonal ports to feed 
the patch but to achieve this it is also required to have a square patch to have the same 
characteristics and specifications in both ports otherwise the width and length of the patch in 
aspect of each port would be reversed so the radiation characteristics will differ , another 
challenging design parameter is to achieve the highest XPD without affecting other parameters 
such as scattering parameters , input impedance and also the gain of the antenna , the feeding 
lines are also challenging that a 50ohm microstrip lines’ width is about 3mm whereas the width 
of the patch is about 3.5 mm so this was not physically or in terms of matching applicable to 
have achieve matching between ports and the antenna and having input impedance of 50ohm 
in a relatively wideband with minimum imaginary part to be in resonance mode which is 
preferable for the antenna to be radiative in as it has pure real impedance, It is also required to 
achieve high isolation between the two ports to increase the XPD.
